## Abstract: 
<p>Mammalian carnivores are declining worldwide due to human activities. Behavioural
indicators have the potential to help identify population trends
and inform conservation actions, although this area of research is understudied.
We investigate whether behaviour is linked to abundance in a
community of carnivores in the Masai Mara National Reserve, Kenya.
Anthropogenic disturbance increased exponentially in parts of the Reserve
between 1988 and 2017, mainly due to daily incursions by large numbers
of livestock and tourists. Previous research showed that hyena behaviour
changed markedly during this period. Through a series of vignettes, we
inquire whether hyena behaviours correlate with changes in abundance of
hyenas themselves, or those of other carnivore species in the region. We
find that changes in spotted hyena behaviour in disturbed areas, but not
in undisturbed areas, can be linked to changes in their demography (Vignette
1). We also find that declines in observed lion–hyena interactions as
well as increases in spotted hyena abundance are likely caused by competitive
release of hyenas from declining lion abundance (Vignette 2). Finally,
we demonstrate that in some cases, hyena behaviour and demography is
linked to the density and distribution of sympatric carnivores, and that behavioural
changes in hyenas can provide information on shifts within the
carnivore community (Vignettes 3 and 4). Our vignettes reveal intriguing
relationships between behaviour and demography that should be explored
in future research. Pairing behavioural studies with more traditional monitoring
efforts can yield useful insights regarding population and
community trends, and aid wildlife conservation and management.</p>
<p>This article is part of the theme issue ‘Linking behaviour to dynamics
of populations and communities: application of novel approaches in
behavioural ecology to conservation’.</p>
